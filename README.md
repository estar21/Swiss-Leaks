# Swiss-Leaks
All material related to Swiss Leaks 2013 / HSBC leaks (Laguarde list)

Data from https://cloudfront-files-1.publicintegrity.org/offshoreleaks/csv.zip

1. “nodes.csv” contains the information of the more than 251,000 nodes the ICIJ Offshore Leaks Database has.
2. “edges_1direction.csv” describes the relationships between the nodes.
3. “node_countries.csv” has all the countries associated to every node. You can read more about how we associated every node to a country.
4. “countries.csv” is a lookup list of countries and their codes from the US National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency.

For the db schema (which I worked out), please see the schema.xls file at https://github.com/estar21/Swiss-Leaks/blob/master/schema.xlsx.
